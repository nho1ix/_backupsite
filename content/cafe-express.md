- Preparation time: ~1-2 weeks
- Feasibility: Reasonable
- Profit margin: Unsure, but probably pretty good

## Layout Plan

1. Research:
    - Cheap / good coffee beans
    - Roasting / brewing methods
    - Temperature / cold / hot brew
    - How to use espresso machine
    - Bang for buck price to sell for profit margin
2. Buy an expensive / good coffee or expresso machine
3. Mobilize the setup by setting up a coffee shop in a van
4. Sell coffee at decent profit range (maybe $2 or $3)
5. Profit
